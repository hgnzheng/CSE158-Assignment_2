## Introduction

For this assignment, we need to find a dataset that is large enough to perform a predictive task. At the end, we would need to write a report to describe the whole process -- we are using LaTeX to type up the report.

We are using [Google Local (2021) and (2018)](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#google_local) datasets from Prof. Julian McAuley's recommender systems dataset website.
